# broadway

## What is?
Broadway is a simple landing website for a design company that's still awaiting a few bits. (i.e. anything past the first page break). Maybe when I've got some time I'll get onto that.

## And why?
Mainly, I've developed this to get some practice on:
- Using the command line to upload straight to Github
- That's it really
- Actually, basic HTML and CSS revision too

#### Where did all this come from?
I'm currently doing the 'Build Websites from Scratch' Codecadamy Pro Course and this is the third project. I've gone a lil rogue and changed some bits from the brief that didn't sit well with my obsessive attitude. Have a look at 'Issues' if you want to uncover that.
